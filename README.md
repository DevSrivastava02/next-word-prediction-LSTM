# next-word-prediction-LSTM
This project implements a Next Word Prediction system using an LSTM-based neural network. It trains on textual data to learn language patterns and predict the most probable next word in a given sequence. Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and NLP preprocessing techniques for effective language modeling.
